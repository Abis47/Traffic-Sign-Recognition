# Traffic-Sign-Recognition
- There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.

## Dataset information
- The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

## Information about this project
- In this project, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories.To classify the images into their respective categories, we will build a CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network). CNN is best for image classification purposes. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles. 

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Also I made the GUI using Tkinter for our traffic signs classifier.

- All codes I uploaded in this repository and link for downloading dataset also provided below.
